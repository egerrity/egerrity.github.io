            <p>Create easy to use styles, components, and patterns libraries, encourage adoption among both designers and developers, create a foundation for future customization that better reflects our brand and user's needs.</p>

            <h4>What led us to begin the effort to rehab our design system?</h4>
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            <p>Prior to switching from Sketch to Figma, the designers had components that were a bit difficult to use, and not always in line with the components that the developers had access to.
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            This lead to a lot of confusion. Developers would see a design in Sketch (for example, a button) and hard code it if it was designed differently than the component they had access to. 
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            This miscommunication resulted in inconsistent implementation of our system and lots of hard-coding that meant wide-spread changes would be extremely difficult to implement.
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            Being a startup, there was little time to devote to this prior to my opportunity to join the team. My manager and I wanted to get this problem under control before it snownballed to the point that we would struggle even more to correct it.</p>

          <h4>Problems to solve for:</h4>
          <span class="br"></span>
          <p>The team was using Sketch. This made collaboration difficult, and contributed to a disconnected system. I, along with the Director of Design </p>
          <span class="br"></span>
          <ol>
            <li>Developers and Designers didn't have a common language to speak about standard styles, components, and page templates.</li>
            <li>Lack of standardization led to developers interpreting design files literally. This caused the site to have a lot of issues with hard-coded colors, bespoke buttons and other components that would cause us to have to strategize about how we would handle any wide-spread design updates.</li>
            <li>The web app had many responsive design issues. Part of this initiative was focused on solving this problem so users could more easily use the app on their phones.</li>

            <span class="brmedium"></span>

              <li>We worked with engineering to identify painpoints, and the level of impact they had.</li>
              <li>We surveyed designers to find out how many colors in our overly-extensive palette were being used on a regular basis.</li>
              <li>I led weekly meetings with a team of 3 designers and 2 engineers to make sure we were meeting the needs of both teams.</li>
              <li>We did competitve analysis of other companies' solutions and collected them in a figma document to use as inspiration for structuring the libraries as well as the future documentation site.</li>

                <h6>Implemented Improvements:</h6>
                    <p>I created a foundational library of styles that allowed designers to use styles that the engineers had already set up in variable form.</p>
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>   
                    <p>I created a component library that coordinated our design work with engineering and gave design and engineering a basis to improve consistency in the app.</p>
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>   
                    <p>I led a team of two designers in building a template library for pattern level components. We used the component library to build out common pattern level components like forms, inventory cards and more.</p>
                    <span class="brmedium"></span>   
                    <p>The previously mentioned team used these pattern level components to begin creating page templates that designers could grab and detach to make changes.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h6>Planned Improvements:</h6>
                <p>Our small team was working on developing a documentation site that would allow us to create a shared language between design and engineering.</p>
                <span class="brmedium"></span>   
                <p>Our goal was to create a single source of truth by evangelizing the system to increase adoption, and we were having success in gathering allies on the engineering team</p>

              </div>
              <div>
                <h6>Implemented Improvements:</h6>
                <p>Because we were able to update the styles library in Figma with relevant code information, engineers were able to access information more easily in Figma's inspect panel.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h6>Planned Improvements:</h6>
                <p>Many of these are the same, as the main goal is to improve communication and consistency.</p>
                <span class="brmedium"></span>   
                <p>The documentation site would have enabled engineers to grab code snippets in one place to ensure that the entire team was on the same page: no more unnecessary hard coding of colors or components.</p>
                <span class="brmedium"></span>   
                <p>There was inconsistent adoption of layout standards. The ultimate goal was to make sure that layout implementation was standardized, and responsive web layout was user-friendly.</p>

                      <h4>Foundations</h4>
                      <p>I created a complete, code-conscious library of styles that allowed the design and engineering teams to work together. This library made it easy for design to adhere to the current system that was used by the engineers.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Components</h4>
                        <p>I created a library of components that included everything from buttons to text fields. This library increased the design team's efficiency and allowed us to ship features much faster, and with better quality. Having components with appropriate autolayouts applied is great for engineering as well.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Patterns</h4>
                        <p>We were able to complete a number of commonly used pattern-level components and page templates while we were working on this project. These were very helpful for engineers and designers alike. We were able to use these to have a high-level overview of the product as well as to create new layouts more quickly.</p>

            <p>During our tenure at Upside Business Travel, we were able to work together to create the beginnings of a great system.
