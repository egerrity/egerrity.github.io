            <h4>So what is 10-21 Police Phone?</h4>
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            <p>Police officers and other public safety professionals are almost never given a “company” or “department” phone to use while on duty. This causes a few different problems for the people that make up our user base. 
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            If you call a citizen from a blocked number, they are unlikely to answer. As robo/spam calls become more of a problem, so does the likelihood you will get sent to voicemail when blocking your number.
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            If you do not block your number, you are more likely to be answered. However, the trade off is that the community member now has your contact information. This is a pain for public safety workers, and protecting their privacy is a big concern.
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            10-21 Police Phone tackles those issues by allowing public safety professionals to call citizens from a real number that is not their own. This maintains their privacy while minimizing the phone tag that results from using a blocked number. It also allows users to automatically manage incoming calls. Community members who return the user’s call are given the option to request a call back or be forwarded to an after hours number for immediate assistance.</p>

          <h4>Problems to solve for:</h4>
          <span class="br"></span>
          <p>10-21 Police Phone was built quickly, and without any formal UX considerations or designer input. While the app was functional and widely used in the industry, there were a few problems:</p>
          <span class="br"></span>
          <ol>
            <li>The app had been historically free to use, and was not generating any revenue for the company despite it having a large user base. </li>
            <li>As spam/robo calls become more and more prevalent and obnoxious, users were having a harder and harder time connecting with the community members they needed to talk to, despite using the app.</li>
            <li>The app’s interface was outdated. We wanted to approach the redesign as stepping stone to establishing standard components across our products and eventually streamline overall user experience with a design system down the road.  The future goal was to ensure that no matter which product our customers are using, the interface is familiar and the experience seamless.</li>
          </ol>

            <h4>Initial Exploration:</h4>
            <span class="br"></span>      
            <p>Our goal was to add thoughtful features that would increase a users' likelihood of being answered on the first try or called back quickly. We also wanted to explore other ways to generally improve the overall experience of using the app.</p>
            <span class="brmedium"></span>     
            <ul>
              <li>Hypothesis 1: 10-21 Police Phone outbound calls are not being answered initially because the community members being called don’t accept or outright ignore calls from unknown numbers.</li>
              <li>Hypothesis 2: 10-21 Police Phone calls are not returned because people are less and less likely to even check their voicemails at all. If the community member being called doesn’t check their voicemail, they will not know a 10-21 Police Phone user tried to call.</li>
              <li>Hypothesis 3: Users would find it useful to be able to view their entire call history for reporting purposes.</li>
              <li>Hypothesis 4: Users would benefit from being able to tell who they were calling/being called back by.</li>
              <li>Hypothesis 5: Users may benefit from a dark mode that may be easier to use when on patrol at night.</li>

            <span class="br"></span>                 
            <p> This rough sketch of potential subscribers attempted to outline motives for users to upgrade to premium. These personas also outlined early feature additions and possible names/symbols for each feature idea. Initial feature ideas of note included the following:</p>
            <span class="brmedium"></span>   
          </div>
          <div id="cs-persona-section">

                <h6>Proposed Feature:</h6>
                <p>Automated text message that identifies the user's call as being from a Police Officer.
                This user is having trouble getting answered, and it is causing them to distrust the app. Their main frustration is incessant phone tag that wastes their time and makes their job harder. Many of these users (from prior research) recognize that the people they are calling don’t answer phone calls from unknown numbers, or check their voice mail.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h6>Possible Solution/Feature to attract this Persona:</h6>
                <p>We hypothesized that we could greatly increase the rate of calls being returned with a feature that would identify any phone call that goes to voicemail with an automated text message that tells the community member an officer is trying to reach them.</p>

                This user has trouble keeping track of who they have called and when. It’s difficult to remember which number belongs to the person they need to call, and they have to search through their notes or contacts to figure out which number belongs to which community member. In addition, they may want some record of who they called in order to protect themselves in the event of a false complaint being filed against them.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h6>Possible Solution/Feature to attract this Persona:</h6>
                <p> We wanted to explore the potential benefits of adding any or all of the following feature possibilities: the ability to nickname numbers in the user’s call log, expanding a user’s call log to include all calls from the date of subscription (free users cut off at 10 call records), and/or tapping into any available caller ID data and displaying it when appropriate.</p>

            <span class="br"></span>
            <p>We sent out an email requesting participation in a user feedback survey that received around 450 responses. The response rate was well over what we expected and led us to several conclusions:</p>

                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                <li>User responses uncovered a previously uncovered painpoint around Caller ID: our users needed a way to block community members from spamming them with fake information/over-frequent calls.</li>
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                <li>In addition, users were facing a similar problem that was causing the community members they called to not answer: they don’t know who is calling until they pick up. This further encouraged us to invest in a more robust caller ID feature.</li>
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                <li>We were able to compile a list of leads from respondents who were incorrectly using 10-21 Police Phone when they should have been using one of our other enterprise products.</li>
