            <h4>I worked with our scrum team to strategize the best way to add the following features:</h4>
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            <p>Cancelations: Users were only able to cancel flights that met certain criteria in the app. This created some interesting problems to solve around how to notify the user if they were ineligible.
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            Travel credits: Travelers needed to be able to check out with credits with RTFs when purchasing a Southwest Airlines flight. It's a feature that had to be added to the post-shopping flow due to technical restraints. We needed a way to display any credits they had available on their account, and set out to make sure anything we implemented would scale up to support multiple airlines.
            <!--
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            Southwest Earlybird: Travelers were now able to purchase Earlybird preferred seating in the app. Previously they would have to do through a customer service agent, or leave the app. Travelers would have the option to add on Earlybird pre and post-purchase.</p>

          <p>We were on a tight timeline to ship this feature due to pressure from the airline. My PM and I collected data on how often travelers were calling into the customer service center for help while on trips, and found out that almost no one was using the app while "on-trip."  Through interviewing users, we found that it was frustrating to have to call in and cancel when in a busy airport. This helped the product manager and I decide which of the three required features would be developed first.</p>
          <span class="br"></span>
          <ol>
            <li>The way users access their itinerary, flight legs, and purchased "inventory" presented some user experience problems that were not possible to fix and stay in scope. This required me to be creative with microcopy and placement of cancellation buttons. </li>
            <li>The app was unable to make the call to determine eligibility for self service cancellation before the user clicked through to cancel. This was especially problematic because the load time on Southwest's end is about 40 seconds. For the MVP, we had to make some hard decisions around the experience to stay in scope.</li>
            <li>I needed to find a way to alert the user to the refundable status of their add-ons, as well as where their refund was going. Depending on the purchase date, fare class, and time-to-departure, there were several circumstances we needed to account for.</li>

          <div class="iteration-heading">
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>I had inherited the app from designers who had already left the company. In addition, it had been neglected due to lack of resources that could be dedicated to the apps experience. Here are some of the challenges I faced when working through this problem.</p>
          </div>
          <span class="brmedium"></span>
          <div class="cs-image-container cancel-user-flow">

            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="cs-challenges">
            <p>Due to the way the app was structured compared to the online shopping experience, I came up against some really difficult logistical challenges. A plan was in the works to refactor the shopping flow so we could clear up some of these confusing UX problems.</p>
            <span class="br"></span>
            <ul>
              <li>It's not immediately clear that you can click on your itinerary items to see your flight.</li>
              <span class="br"></span>
              <li>Because you can't see the flight as a whole, any action that can only apply to an entire flight (for example, you can't cancel one leg of a flight in this instance) is implicitly misrepresented by the way this was structured.</li>
              <span class="br"></span>
              <li>Similarly, I couldn't just put cancel flight on the itinerary screen (middle). If someone had purchased multiple flights online, they would show up in the app. That would cause engineering problems as well as a confusing user experience.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <span class="brlarge"></span>


        <!-------------------------process--------------------------------> 
          <div class="iteration-heading">
            <h4>Some first iterations of the cancellation flow</h4>
            <p>In initial "wireframing" (for efficiency's sake I used screenshots for much of this work), I was working off the assumption that the user needed to be informed of every piece of information tied to their potential cancellation. I tested this with users (UserTesting.com) and found that it was either ignored, or overwhelming.</p>
          </div>
          <span class="brmedium"></span>

          <span class="brmedium"></span>
          <div class="cs-challenges">
            <p>Here is when I started to run into problems. Because you can't cancel a single leg, or pull the data required to indicate a flight is eligible for cancellation, this experience becomes murky. I had a long whiteboarding meeting with other designers (sadly lost when the company shut down) and determined that without extensive work on the IA of the shopping and trips experience, we would have to settle for a bandaid in the meantime.</p>

          <div class="iteration-heading">
            <h4>Final User Experience (MVP)</h4>
            <p>From there, I stripped out the chips, and reduced the number of inline messages to two options. This reduced the burden on engineering, and tested much better the second round. This iteration had a 3 second drop in time to cancel.</p>

            <div class="cs-challenges">
              <p>In the end, after consulting with my teammates (design and UX writing) I came to the conclusion that the best thing we could do for now would be to change the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"cancel flight"</span> language to <span style="font-weight: bold;">"cancel trip."</span> While not ideal, this would work well enough until we got through tech debt blockers.</p>
              <span class="br"></span>
              <p>Cancel trip on the itinerary screen always said <span style="font-weight: bold;">"cancel trip."</span> In addition, the user can only self-service cancel their flight if they <span style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> purchased a flight. My assumption is that will not be too confusing to see <span style="font-weight: bold;">"cancel trip."</span> if all you have in your trip bundle is a flight. Unfortunately, this is not ideal. I planned to follow up with users that cancelled flights using the app. Unfortunately, we weren't able to iterate on this part of the product before the company closed. >

          <h3>Travel Credits</h3>
          <p>Now that users were able to cancel their flights in app, we needed to give them a way to view their credits and use them to make purchases.

          <p>We were still on a tight timeline to ship this feature due to pressure from the airline. While this feature did not require much research as it had already been implemented in our web app, we spent a good deal of time ensuring that mobile best practices were followed. The amount of information in the travel credit menu posed a challenge on small screens. I also needed to solve for how the user would purchase flights with their credits.</p>
          <span class="br"></span>
          <ol>
            <li>Travel credits in our web app were displayed in a 4 column table. I needed to be able to effectively condense this information that was easy to read and sort through on mobile.</li>
            <li>While we only supported Southwest Airlines' credits at the time of launch, the solution needed to be scalable. Eventually we would support other airlines, and I wanted to ensure we wouldn't be revisiting the user experience in a year.</li>
            <li>The user needed to be alerted that they could apply their credit at check out. Initially, I had hoped to be able to include that information in the shopping flow, but that was deemed out of scope for v1.</li>

        <div class="section-padding feature-section-heading" id="earlybird">
          <h3 id="earlybird">EarlyBird Priority Boarding</h3>
          <p>My PM and I had been hearing customers talk about how they wished they could purchase add-ons like priority boarding, extra luggage, and seat upgrades on the go. While looking through reviews of our product, these pain points would come up as well. As a start, we began working on EarlyBird due to its smaller scope for an easy win. We were able to integrate the ability to purchase Southwest's EarlyBird Priority Boarding upgrade into the app—for both pre and post-purchase.</p>

          <h4>Problems to solve for:</h4>
          <span class="br"></span>
          <p>There were two elements to this feature add. Users needed to be able to purchase EarlyBird in the checkout flow, but because the upgrade is available up to 36 hours before departure, the user should be able to upgrade after they've made a purchase.</p>
          <span class="br"></span>
          <ol>
            <li>We had to make some decisions around whether or not we would let ineligible users know that they weren't able to purchase the upgrade.</li>
            <li>We didn't want to bury the option to purchase the upgrade, but due to the previously mentioned tech debt, we didn't have the option to rework the current experience. Currently, the user can only view one leg of the trip at a time. However, you can't purchase EarlyBird for one leg of your trip. This caused confusion for testers at the time. Unfortunately, the work required to fix the shopping and trip flow was going to be a huge engineering lift.</li>
            <li>I needed to ensure that the user would see the value add during check out and be able to tell that they had EarlyBird applied to their ticket after purchase.</li>
          </ol>

            <h4>Initial Discussions</h4>
            <p>We recognized at the outset that we would have to make some concessions due to tech debt. I brainstormed with my PM and several of my teammates to determine the best way to approach this difficult problem.</p>

            <h4>Final User Experience (MVP)</h4>
            <p>From there, I stripped out the chips, and reduced the number of inline messages to two options. This reduced the burden on engineering, and tested much better the secound. This iteration had a 3 second drop in time to cancel.</p>
