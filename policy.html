            <h2>Upside Business Travel</h2>
            <h3>Our clients needed a way to keep track of travel spending and always need to be mindful of duty of care responsibilities. </h3>
            <p>Problem: Clients needed to be able to manage spending and ensure that their employees were booking vehicles that met the standards of their business.</p>

            <h6>Project Goals</h6>
            <p>Give admins more granular control over their policies without making the process too cumbersome or difficult to use. We also did a general test to ensure the copy on the page was not confusing to the user.</p>

            <p>Before we started working on how to best add this feature, users were only able to set maximum price per day and the amount of time reservations needed to be booked in advance of their trip.
            <span class="brmedium"></span>
            We did competitive analysis, surveying, and testing to determine if our hypothesis was backed by user input and data</p>

            <span class="br"></span>      
            <p>We explored a few different hypotheses including solutions for hotel pricing based on location, star rating minimums and, setting approved vehicle types for rentals. In order to keep the scope reasonable, we decided to investigate the latter two.</p>
            <span class="brmedium"></span>     
            <ul>
              <li>Hypothesis 1: Minimum star ratings would help admins improve quality of working conditions, and insure employee safety.</li>
              <li>Hypothesis 2: Control over rental car types would have a similar effect as the above, but also help admins control spending.</li>

                <h6>Value Add:</h6>
                <p>Adding more options for travel policy oversight will help admins keep spending on rental cars in the appropriate range as well as allowing them to insure that their employees are renting cars that meet the company's safety and quality standards.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>I prototyped the two different car selection options as well as the star rating setting for hotels. In addition, we asked general questions about the existing copy to determine if any of the language was confusing to users. We uploaded this to usertesting.com with a requirement that the user arranged business travel for their colleagues.</li>
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                <li>We found that some of the previous language was indeed confusing to users, and uploaded a new survey with updated copy to test.</li>
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                <li>We found that users were confused by the chip design, but that the checkbox format was intuitive.</li>
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                <li>Some users stated that they had similar vehicle policies at their current place of work.</li>
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                <li>Competitive Analysis showed us that star rating requirements were fairly standard, however, our users responded more positively to a minimum rating during testing.</li>
